NAME
----
stratis - Configure Stratis local storage pools

SYNOPSIS
--------
  stratis [GLOBAL OPTIONS] pool <command> [args] [COMMAND OPTIONS]
  stratis [GLOBAL OPTIONS] filesystem|fs <command> [args] [COMMAND OPTIONS]
  stratis [GLOBAL OPTIONS] blockdev <command> [args] [COMMAND OPTIONS]
  stratis [GLOBAL OPTIONS] daemon <redundancy|version>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*stratis* is a command-line tool to create, modify, and destroy Stratis pools,
and the filesystems allocated from the pool.

Stratis creates a *pool* from one or more block devices (*blockdevs*), and
then enables multiple *filesystems* to be created from the pool.

If the block device is already in use, its signature has to be erased using
*wipefs -a <blockdev>* before trying to add it to a pool.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
--------------
--version::
	Show stratis-cli version.
--help, -h::
	Show help on command.
--propagate::
	(For debugging.) Allow exceptions raised during execution to propagate.

COMMANDS
--------
pool create <pool_name> <blockdev> [<blockdev>..]::
     Create a pool from one or more block devices, with the given pool name.
pool list::
     List all pools on the system.
pool rename <old_pool_name> <new_pool_name>::
     Rename a pool.
pool destroy <pool_name>::
     Destroy a pool and all the filesystems created from it.
pool add-data <pool_name> <blockdev> [<blockdev>..]::
	 Add one or more blockdevs to an existing pool, to enlarge its storage
	 capacity.
pool add-cache <pool_name> <blockdev> [<blockdev>..]::
	 Add one or more blockdevs to an existing pool, to be used as a cache
	 instead of additional storage. Typically, smaller and faster drives,
	 such as SSDs, are used for this purpose.
         NOTE: There is a temporary restriction on the total size of the
         cache device of 32 TiB. Adding devices to the cache so that the
         cumulative size of all the devices in the cache exceeds 32 TiB will
         result in an error.
filesystem create <pool_name> <fs_name> [<fs_name>..]::
	   Create one or more filesystems from the specified pool.
           NOTE: There is a temporary restriction on the number of filesystems
           that can be specified with this command. Specifying more than one
           filesystem will result in an error.
filesystem snapshot <pool_name> <fs_name> <snapshot_name>::
	   Snapshot the filesystem in the specified pool.
filesystem list [pool_name]::
	   List all filesystems that exist in the specified pool, or all
	   pools, if no pool name is given.
filesystem destroy <pool_name> <fs_name> [<fs_name>..]::
	   Destroy one or more filesystems that exist in the specified pool.
filesystem rename <pool_name> <fs_name> <new_name>::
     Rename a filesystem.
blockdev list [pool_name]::
	 List all blockdevs that make up the specified pool, or all pools, if
	 no pool name is given.
daemon redundancy::
       List the redundancy levels that the Stratis service supports.
daemon version::
       Show the Stratis service's version.

REPORTING BUGS & DEVELOPMENT
-----------------------------
GitHub for issues and development::
       https://github.com/stratis-storage, against either 'stratis-cli' or
'stratisd' projects, based on likelihood of issue being with the command-line
tool or the service daemon.
Mailing list::
	stratis-devel@lists.fedorahosted.org for general development
	discussion
Unknown values::
	stratis-cli uses the Stratis API. If the API returns values that
	stratis-cli cannot interpret, stratis-cli will substitute "???". If
	encountered, upgrading to the latest version of stratis-cli, or filing
	an issue, is recommended.
