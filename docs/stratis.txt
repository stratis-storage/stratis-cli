stratis - Configure Stratis local storage pools

SYNOPSIS
--------
  stratis [GLOBAL OPTIONS] pool <command> [args] [COMMAND OPTIONS]
  stratis [GLOBAL OPTIONS] filesystem|fs <command> [args] [COMMAND OPTIONS]
  stratis [GLOBAL OPTIONS] blockdev <command> [args] [COMMAND OPTIONS]
  stratis [GLOBAL OPTIONS] key <command> [args] [COMMAND OPTIONS]
  stratis [GLOBAL OPTIONS] report <report_name>
  stratis [GLOBAL OPTIONS] daemon <redundancy|version>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*stratis* is a command-line tool to create, modify, and destroy Stratis pools,
and the filesystems allocated from the pool.

Stratis creates a *pool* from one or more block devices (*blockdevs*), and
then enables multiple *filesystems* to be created from the pool. The user can set
*keys* for use with pool encryption.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
--------------
--version::
	Show stratis-cli version.
--help, -h::
	Show help on command.
--propagate::
	(For debugging.) Allow exceptions raised during execution to propagate.
--unhyphenated-uuids::
	(For listing.) Print pool and filesystem UUIDs without hyphens for list commands.

COMMANDS
--------
pool create [--redundancy <redundancy>] [--key-desc <key_desc>] [--clevis <(nbde|tang|tpm2)> [--tang-url <tang_url>] [<(--thumbprint <thp> | --trust-url)>] <pool_name> <blockdev> [<blockdev>..]::
     Create a pool from one or more block devices, with the given pool name.
pool list::
     List all pools on the system.
pool rename <old_pool_name> <new_pool_name>::
     Rename a pool.
pool destroy <pool_name>::
     Destroy a pool and all the filesystems created from it.
pool add-data <pool_name> <blockdev> [<blockdev>..]::
	 Add one or more blockdevs to an existing pool, to enlarge its storage
	 capacity.
pool init-cache <pool_name> <blockdev> [<blockdev>..]::
	 Initialize a cache for an existing pool.
	 Add one or more blockdevs to a pool, to be used as cache
	 instead of additional storage. Typically, smaller and faster
	 drives, such as SSDs, are used for this purpose.
pool add-cache <pool_name> <blockdev> [<blockdev>..]::
	 Add one or more blockdevs to an existing pool with an initialized cache.
pool unlock <(keyring | clevis)>::
     Unlock all devices that are part of an encrypted pool registered with stratisd
     but that have not yet been opened. The available unlock methods are
     *keyring* or *clevis*.
pool bind <(nbde|tang)> <pool name> <url> <(--thumbprint <thp> | --trust-url)>::
     Bind the devices in the specified pool to a supplementary encryption
     mechanism that uses NBDE (Network-Bound Disc Encryption). *tang* is
     an alias for *nbde*.
pool bind tpm2 <pool name>::
     Bind the devices in the specified pool to a supplementary encryption
     mechanism that uses TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module).
pool bind keyring <pool name> <keydesc>::
     Bind the devices in the specified pool to a supplementary encryption
     mechanism using a key in the kernel keyring.
pool unbind <(clevis|keyring)> <pool name> ::
     Unbind the devices in the specified pool from the specified encryption
     mechanism.
filesystem create <pool_name> <fs_name> [<fs_name>..]::
	   Create one or more filesystems from the specified pool.
           NOTE: There is a temporary restriction on the number of filesystems
           that can be specified with this command. Specifying more than one
           filesystem will result in an error.
filesystem snapshot <pool_name> <fs_name> <snapshot_name>::
	   Snapshot the filesystem in the specified pool.
filesystem list [pool_name]::
	   List all filesystems that exist in the specified pool, or all
	   pools, if no pool name is given.
filesystem destroy <pool_name> <fs_name> [<fs_name>..]::
	   Destroy one or more filesystems that exist in the specified pool.
filesystem rename <pool_name> <fs_name> <new_name>::
     Rename a filesystem.
blockdev list [pool_name]::
	 List all blockdevs that make up the specified pool, or all pools, if
	 no pool name is given.
key list::
     List all key-descriptions in the kernel keyring that can be used for encryption.

     Set a key in the kernel keyring for use with encryption.
key reset <(--keyfile-path <path> | --capture-key)> <key_desc>::
     Reset the key data of an existing key in the kernel keyring.
key unset <key_desc>::
     Unset a key in the kernel keyring so it is no longer available for encryption
     operations.
report <report_name>::
        Get a report from the daemon regarding its internal state.
        The engine_state_report name will be supported in future releases.
        Any other report name should be considered unstable and may be removed
        in a future release. The JSON schema of any report must always be considered unstable.
daemon redundancy::
       List the redundancy levels that the Stratis service supports.
daemon version::
       Show the Stratis service's version.

OPTIONS
-------
--redundancy::
        The redundancy for the created pool. The only option is "none" which
        is also the default.
--key-desc::
        The key description of the key that should be used to encrypt the
        created pool. The key description must correspond to a key
        set in the kernel keyring with the *key* command.
--keyfile-path <path> | --capture-key::
	These mutually exclusive options allow a user to specify a key used
        for encryption in one of two ways. The *--keyfile-path* option requires
        an argument, the path to a file containing the key. If the
        *--capture-key* option is selected instead, the user must enter the key
        at the ensuing prompt. The key value is terminated at the first newline
        character that the user enters, and does not include the newline
        character. On the other hand, if the file specified as an argument for
        the *--keyfile-path* option contains a newline character anywhere, the
        newline character will be included in the key value.
--thumbprint <thp> | --trust-url::
        These mutually exclusive options allow a user to specify that a tang
        server's URL should be trusted and the server's credentials accepted
        without verification, or to supply a previously provided thumbprint for
        verification.
--tang-url <url>::
        If creating a pool encrypted via NBDE using a tang server, specifies
        the URL of the server.
--clevis <(nbde | tang | tpm2)> ::
        The clevis method that should be used to encrypt the created pool.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
STRATIS_DBUS_TIMEOUT::
	 Sets a timeout for any Stratis D-Bus call. If this environment variable is
	 not set, a default value of 120 seconds is used for the timeout.
	 The accepted STRATIS_DBUS_TIMEOUT environment variable values are:
         1. an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 1073741823 (inclusive),
         which represents the timeout length in milliseconds
         2. -1, which represents the libdbus default timeout

LIST OUTPUT FIELDS
------------------

FIELDS for stratis pool list

Name::
	  The name of the pool.
Total Physical::
	  The physical usage statistics for the pool (Total / Used / Free).
Properties::
          Boolean valued properties that the pool may have. Each property has
          a two-letter camel-case code. If the pool does not have the
          property, a '~', for negation, is prepended to the property code.
          If the engine experienced an error when obtaining the property, a
          "?", representing "unknown", is prepended to the property code.
          The property codes are: Ca - indicates the pool has a cache,
          Cr - indicates the pool is encrypted.
UUID::
          The UUID of the pool.

FIELDS for stratis filesystem list

Pool Name::
	  The name of the pool containing the filesystem.
Used::
	  The amount of storage space used in the pool by this filesystem.
Created::
	  The time the filesystem was created.
Device::
	  The device path to use for mounting the filesystem.
UUID::
	  The UUID of the filesystem.


FIELDS for stratis blockdev list

Pool Name::
	  The name of the pool using the block device.
Device Node::
	  The device node of the block device. A second device node will
          be displayed in parentheses if the block device is encrypted. This
          device node is the device node of the associated dm-crypt device.
Physical Size::
	  The total size of the device on which stratisd places Stratis
          metadata. If the device is encrypted, this size will be slightly
          smaller than the total size of the device specified by the user; it
          will be the size of the associated dm-crypt device.
Tier::
	  The data tier type ("Data" or "Cache")

FIELDS for stratis key list

Key Description::
	  The key description corresponding to a key in the kernel keyring that
	  that can be used for encryption.

RESTRICTIONS
------------
Encryption and a cache are mutually exclusive choices. If a pool is encrypted,
an attempt to initialize a cache will result in an error.

There is a restriction on the total size of the
cache device of 32 TiB. Adding devices to the cache so that the
cumulative size of all the devices in the cache exceeds 32 TiB will
result in an error.

NOTES
-----
If a block device appears to be already in use, stratisd will refuse to
claim it. To allow use with stratisd, any signature on the device must
first be erased. Please carefully verify the identity and availability of
the device before taking such a step.

REPORTING BUGS & DEVELOPMENT
-----------------------------
GitHub for issues and development::
       https://github.com/stratis-storage, against either 'stratis-cli' or
'stratisd' projects, based on likelihood of issue being with the command-line
tool or the service daemon.
Mailing list::
	stratis-devel@lists.fedorahosted.org for general development
	discussion
Unknown values::
	If the stratisd D-Bus API returns values that stratis-cli cannot
	interpret, stratis-cli will substitute "???". If encountered,
	upgrading to the latest version of stratis-cli, or filing an
	issue, is recommended.
Unobtainable values::
	If the stratisd D-Bus API indicates that a value is unobtainable,
	stratis-cli will substitute "FAILURE". This may indicate something
	wrong with the pool, blockdev, or filesystem. In some cases,
	restarting stratisd may resolve the issue.
