stratis-cli 2.0.1
=================
Python import sorter: isort (4.3.4)
Python auto-formatter: black (19.3b0)

stratis-cli 2.0.0
=================
Python auto-formatter: black (18.9b0)

New minimum stratisd version requirement: 2.0.0

- Expect new versions of D-Bus service and interface names:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/project/issues/103
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/389

- Use newly introduced stratisd D-Bus interface FetchProperties
  to obtain properties of engine objects for list methods:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/project/issues/52
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/381

  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/388
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/406

- Remove idempotent behavior on certain commands:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/project/issues/51
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/358
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/366

  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/400
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/401

- Expect that all size values placed on the D-Bus represent bytes:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/383

- Expect that optional D-Bus properties are represented as tuples:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/project/issues/37

stratis-cli 1.1.0
=================
Python auto-formatter: black (18.9b0)

New dependency requirements:
  - dbus-python-client-gen: 0.7

- Add a STRATIS_DBUS_TIMEOUT environment variable:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/issues/252
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/345

- Fix a bug where stratis exited with 0 exit code and printed usage to
  standard output in some situations where a command could not be parsed.
  Now print usage message to standard error and exit with code 2:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/issues/248
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/332

- Simplify reporting of errors. If the error has no explanation,
  allow the exception to propagate, otherwise just print the
  explanation. This does not affect any behavior when the --propagate
  flag is set:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/274

- Add an explanation for the error that occurs when the D-Bus times out
  before the daemon responds:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/issues/336
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/347

- Make bash completion aware of --propagate flag:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/300

- Defer loading of _data.py module until the command-line has been parsed.
  This should have no visible effect:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/318
